# pcl-rustic RFCs

This directory holds the project's design RFCs. File naming is mechanical:

```
rfc-{id}-{YYYY-MM-DD}-{kebab-case-title}.md
```

- `id` is a zero-padded four-digit sequence, issued in order (`0001`, `0002`, …). Never reuse.
- `YYYY-MM-DD` is the draft date (the day the RFC was first written, not the day it was accepted).
- `kebab-case-title` is a short slug — prefer ≤ 6 words.

## Process

The authoring guide lives in the Multica shared knowledge repo at
`ArkWhale/multica-home:templates/prompts/rfc-authoring.md`. When drafting a new
RFC for pcl-rustic, read that guide first — it pins the section structure, the
acceptance-criteria format, and what belongs in "open questions" vs. "risks".
